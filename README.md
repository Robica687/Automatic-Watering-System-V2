# Automatic-Watering-System-V2
With the first watering system project I encountered a few problems that need to be solved, so i camed up with a simple solution yet crucial in what comes to material usage.

After a few days, i came up with the idea of adding a battery on the arduino, because i wanted to get rid of the wire that was across the kitchen. After a two week of continuous usage, the battery was dead, so i was going to change the power supply to the first design again. The battery were great if you wanted to use the watering system once in a while.

Within a month, I needed to change the resistive sensors twice, because of corosion. So what i did was a bit of research and got to know about capacitive sensors, that don't corrode overtime, so i got one and updated the code and the system with the new sensor.

Personally, I got rid of the battery supply because i don't want to spend a lot of money on batteries, even tough i will use the project only when i won't be home.
